This is the start of my first blog post&mdash;I am looking forward to seeing my professional progress in regards to web development and in particular with this post, my first portfolio.  

I am creating a blog with Jekyll and github pages; I like the simplicity of not having to have a database or server side lanaguage. 
I have storage of blogs on my github gh-pages account, cloud computing.
