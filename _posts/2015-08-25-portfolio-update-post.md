I am creating a blog site to track progress and changes in web development and in particlar to this post, my portfolio.  
I will be contributing to this blog, to hone my web development skills.  I am using Jekyll and gh-pages to create this blog
site.  I appreciate the simplity of not having to download software and maintain a database or sql server.  

I feel blogs should be simple to use and maintain, so that writing and sharing insights is the main focus.
